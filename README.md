# Spring Training: Resources

## Working Mode

The road-map consists of several steps. In each step, a set of theoretical concepts are explored, supported by reference documentation, book chapters, tutorials and videos. In parallel, a simple application will be built with the learned concepts: the *Online Shop* application.

After the learning material for a given step was sufficiently explored, either some new functionality will be added to this application or old functionality will be refactored.

The application will have little-to-no user interface. Developers are expected to:
 - Write tests to cover the implemented logic.
 - Test the REST interfaces manually with Postman.

All the code written must be published on GitHub. Commits must be pushed when each individual chapter is finished.

For doing static code quality checks, two separate mechanisms will be used:
 - The plugin for SonarLint and the built-in code analysis must be used to fix code issues.
 - [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) will be enabled and developers should check the detected issues periodically. 

## Environment

You can work using your local environment:
 - You need to install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps), [IntelliJ IDEA (Community)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows), SonarLint and Lombok [plugins for IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html#install_plugin_from_repo).
 - If maven does not work because of SSL errors, [setup the Zscaler certificate in your trust store](https://team.msg.de/site/IT/Freigegebene+Dokumente/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2fsite%2fIT%2fFreigegebene%20Dokumente%2fAnleitungen%2fZscaler&FolderCTID=0x012000581B900D5D91664C93095DB345EDAFC4).

## Time Booking

Use the following booking codes to track activities:

|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Schul. & Einarb. JAVA - allg. Einarb.   | Going through the learning material; tutorials; doing own theoretical investigations; attending presentations.    |
| Schul. & Einarb. JAVA - Impl.-Phase     | Online shop implementation.                                                                                       |
| Schul. & Einarb. JAVA - Komm und JF     | Regular calls, internal discussions (on-boarding, off-boarding).                                                  |

In the booking description, please use the following format: `Chapter: Brief activity description`, for the regular calls, simply state the name of the meeting. 

Examples: `1: Reading about dependency injection, spring basics`, `2: Setting up the project.`.

## Online Shop
The application will deal with the management and daily functioning of a small shop. Business processes:
 - **Order creation**: an end customer places an order to buy several products (based on the availability of the products in the stock).
 - **Stock management**: the existing product stocks are updated automatically based on the orders placed by customers.
 - **Shop analytics**: the management must be able to view the evolution of the daily revenue for each individual location of the shop.

Throughout the application, we assume that prices are always in EUR and weights are always in KG.

Online Shop:

 > Go to „Spring Initializr“ and generate a new project:
 > - Group: `ro.msg.learning`,
 > - Artifact: `shop`,
 > - Dependencies: `Web`, `Security`, `JPA`, `JDBC`, `H2`, `Lombok`.
 >
 > Import this project into your IDE (you can delete the `mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd` and `.mvn` files / folders as you have maven in the IDE anyway).
 >
 > Enable the [H2 console for your application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-sql.html#boot-features-sql-h2-console) and configure H2 to use a [file-based storage somewhere on your computer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37903105/how-to-configure-spring-boot-to-use-file-based-h2-database/37969181#37969181).
 >
 > Initialize a local Git repository in the project folder, create a new `develop` branch and commit the project files to this branch. Accept the [GitHub Classroom Assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/nnCheGru). This will create a new GitHub repository for you. Add this new repository as a remote to your local repository and push your new branch and commit.

 - [Introduction to Spring Data JPA](https://www.baeldung.com/the-persistence-layer-with-spring-data-jpa)

Online Shop:
 
 > Create a data model for your application in a Flyway SQL migration. You can refine the model by adding unique indexes (e.g. supplier name) and introducing artificial PKs instead of composite ones and also add a unique index.
 >
 > Translate this data model into Java entity classes. Use Lombok to annotate these classes with @Data annotations to generate getters, setters, equals and hashCode. Hint: *it might be useful to create a base entity class (containing just the primary key) or an interface (containing the primary key getter and setter) to be able to handle entities generically later on.*
 > 
 > Annotate all the entities with the proper JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@OneToMany`, etc). Write Spring Data JPA repositories to allow easy access to your entities.
